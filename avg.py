# Example usage:
# Assuming the video file is located at 'path/to/video.mp4'
# and we want the average image of frames from 100 to 200.
# video_path = 'path/to/video.mp4'
# start_frame = 100
# end_frame = 200
# average_image = calculate_average_image(video_path, start_frame, end_frame)

# To save the average image:
# cv2.imwrite('average_image.png', average_image)

# This function would be used with an actual video file and the OpenCV library installed.
# If you provide a video file and the specific frames, I can adapt this code to work with it.
